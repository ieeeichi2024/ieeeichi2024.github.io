# IEEE ICHI 2024

Homepage for IEEE ICHI 2024 (https://ieeeichi2024.github.io/).

This website is built upon Python `flask` and `frozen-flask` packages for managing the source codes and generating the static version. 

For development, run:

```bash
python server.py
```

For update the static version, run:

```bash
python server.py build
```

The updated static version will be saved into `docs` folder.

Then, you could push the updates to GitHub to update the public site.
