                    It is structured in two parts: 1) a practical tutorial focusing on advanced prompt engineering methods and highlighting privacy requirements, such as HIPAA, GDPR, in healthcare and 2) a hands-on part in the form of a prompt engineering competition. Synthetic EHR data will be used to formulate tasks where participants will be asked to find the best solution using the popular and free OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intended audience are healthcare researchers and professionals, AI scientists, data scientists, and PhD students in the relevant fields as well others. Attendees will gain insights into prompt engineering strategies, experimentation and understand how to potentially achieve more desirable outputs for specific tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tutorial aims to educate participants with the knowledge on how to improve utilization of LLMs in healthcare and encourage creative thinking in solving real-world problems in healthcare informatics using AI solutions.

                Tutorial 3: Usable Interpretability for Large Language Models

                </p>
                <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in natural language processing tasks. Despite these advancements, the opacity of their internal workings presents significant challenges, introducing potential risks for applications built upon these models. Consequently, comprehending and elucidating the operations of LLMs is essential to fully understand their behavior, identify their limitations, and assess their broader social implications. Interpretation methods serve as a crucial tool for understanding LLMs.</p>
                <p>
                    In this half-day tutorial, we introduce several strategies for interpreting LLMs, as well as how the interpretation could guide the improvement of LLMs. Besides introducing the methodologies, we also provide several case studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The target audience of this tutorial includes individuals with a biomedical background but are interested in leveraging LLMs for explainable solutions. The instructors consists of researchers from the University of Georgia, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Wake Forest University. The instructors are experienced in Explainable AI (XAI), and have conducted preliminary research of LLM interpretation.

            <b>Abstract:</b> The great promise of innovative technologies such as AI is that they will advance human health by helping us summarize information, make diagnoses, predict health outcomes, or offer recommendations. However, as we develop ways for doctors or patients to use AI outputs for decisions, it is critical to recognize that information alone does not determine peoples’ decisions. We are also heavily influenced by our environment – whether physical or electronic – and the options that it presents us. These options and the ways they are presented are collectively known as the “choice architecture.” Aspects of the choice architecture which encourage people to select certain options are generally known as “nudges.” Using case studies from biomedical informatics, I will show how choice architectures shape our day-to-day decisions in ways that we are not always aware of, and how they may interfere with the ability to apply information to make decisions. I will also demonstrate how people who design information technologies are in a unique position to leverage intentional choice architectures to reduce cognitive burden and nudge people to select the best option. By broadening our understanding of human decision-making processes, we maximize the likelihood that AI will deliver on its promise.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Health literacy is a widely recognized challenge for public health, with many adults lacking the requisite skills to engage successfully in the management of their health and healthcare. Affecting both individual and societal health outcomes, it particularly exacerbates the increasing physical and psychological burden for patients with multiple health conditions as well as the elderly and disadvantaged populations. Recent developments in digital therapeutic solutions offer an opportunity to apply systems thinking and perspectives to synthesize the myriad components of a multi-pronged approach to improving societal health literacy at scale. This talk will highlight some of these developments with a focus on digital platforms and algorithmic artifacts in the healthcare delivery setting, recognizing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation in identifying and disseminating authoritative and accurate content for educating and empowering patients and the public.
