                Tutorial 2: Training Recurrent Neural Network-Based Model to Predict COVID-19 Patient Risk for PASC using Pytorch_EHR
            </h4>

                    Laila Rasmy, Ziqian Xie, Degui Zhi
                </p>
                <p>Pytorch_EHR is a codebase enabling fast prototyping of deep learning-based predictive models using electronic health records structured data. Rather than a collection of vertical pipelines implementing methods from papers claiming state-of-the-art results, Pytorch_EHR offers efficient implementations of data flow, padding, embeddings, choices of popular recurrent neural networks (RNN) cells and layers structures, prediction heads, and also predictions explanation and visualization. </p>
                <p>This tutorial will provide participants with a clear understanding of deep learning theoretical concepts behind Pytorch_EHR different components, as well as hands-on experience in building an explainable RNN-based model to solve a real-world clinical problem on a cloud-based platform hosting the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) data. URL: <a href="https://github.com/ZhiGroup/pytorch_ehr">https://github.com/ZhiGroup/pytorch_ehr</a>.</p>
                <p>We are targeting researchers and clinicians who are interested to learn more about deep learning methods and how to apply them to answer a real-world clinical question. The audience should have basic python programming skills. In order for the audience to get the best benefit from the tutorial, we would recommend they apply for access to the N3C synthetic data following the instructions on <a href="https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C_synthetic_data">https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C_synthetic_data</a>. </p>

                Tutorial 3: Enabling AI-Augmented Clinical Workflows by Accessing Patient Data in Real-Time with FHIR
            </h4>
                <p>
                    Vincent Major, Walter Wang, Yindalon Aphinyanaphongs
                </p>
                <p>AI systems developed for clinical applications often need to operate in real-time to achieve their intended impacts. However, sourcing data inputs in real-time remains a challenge. FHIR involves a set of interoperable resources that enable reading of patient data directly from the EHR and can be used to retrieve data inputs to feed into AI models. This tutorial will introduce FHIR and walk-through how to configure a FHIR app in Epic and develop python code to automatically read patient data and forward it to downstream AI systems.</p>
                <p>
                    Researchers, AI scientists, data scientists, data engineers, solutions developers, and systems architects are the intended audience of this tutorial but anyone with experience developing AI models with clinical data or an interest in deploying AI systems are welcome. While several others will be required to configure security permissions for the new application, these core roles will be able to design and build a custom system for integration into the EHR. Familiarity with different types of clinical data and how it is stored in the EHR will be beneficial but is not required.

                </p>
                <p>Given the crucial roles of trustworthy machine learning in the deployment of computational medicine problems, this tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of trustworthy machine learning techniques with a focus on biomedical problems, including robustness across different data collections such as batch effects, population stratification, interpretability of machine learning models applied to medical images and genetic sequences, and the fairness challenges of machine learning across various realistic scenarios. Furthermore, in parallel with this tutorial that offers a comprehensive summary of major trustworthy machine learning techniques developed for various biomedical applications, we also aim to provide an overarching perspective on the development of trustworthy machine learning techniques that will not only cover the primary trustworthy machine learning techniques developed but also guide the future development of trustworthy machine learning.</p>
                <p>The tutorial is targeted to the audience of two-fold: the audience with biomedical background and interests in machine learning that are seeking trustworthy machine learning solutions; and the audience with machine learning technical knowledge that either need to be familiarized with more practical challenges in biomedicine, or seeking a higher-level understanding of trustworthy machine learning.</p>

            <b>Abstract:</b> Patient safety informatics is an important area of research because despite our good intentions, medical harms are a principal cause of preventable injury and remain a leading cause of death in the Unites States and globally. Data science and informatics offer significant opportunities for improving patient safety, including the ability to develop predictive models that can identify patients at risk of adverse events and interventions including clinical decision support that can mitigate those risks. Additionally, advanced analytics can help healthcare providers identify patterns and trends that may indicate safety concerns, allowing for proactive interventions to prevent harm. This presentation will highlight data science and informatics tools and approaches that have the potential to significantly improve patient safety and reduce the risk of adverse events in healthcare settings.

                <b>Abstract:</b> Health literacy is a widely recognized challenge for public health, with many adults lacking the requisite skills to engage successfully in the management of their health and healthcare. Affecting both individual and societal health outcomes, it particularly exacerbates the increasing physical and psychological burden for patients with multiple health conditions as well as the elderly and disadvantaged populations. Recent developments in digital therapeutic solutions offer an opportunity to apply systems thinking and perspectives to synthesize the myriad components of a multi-pronged approach to improving societal health literacy at scale. This talk will highlight some of these developments with a focus on digital platforms and algorithmic artifacts in the healthcare delivery setting, recognizing the challenges of misinformation and disinformation in identifying and disseminating authoritative and accurate content for educating and empowering patients and the public.
