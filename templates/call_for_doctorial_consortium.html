                <h2>Doctoral Consortium</h2>
                <p>
                    The 2024 Doctoral Consortium invites doctoral students to submit abstracts on solving problems in healthcare, public health, and everyday wellness through the application of computer science, information science, information technology, and communication technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Doctoral Consortium offers an outstanding opportunity for doctoral students working on health informatics problems to discuss their work in progress and receive feedback and guidance from Consortium mentors.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    All doctoral students whose extended abstract is accepted will be scheduled for a rapid-fire talk where each participant presents a synopsis of their work followed by Q&A. Participants will interact with mentors in small groups to discuss their research and receive further feedback. A panel is also planned on general career strategies in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Participants are invited to present a poster of their research during the main conference. This is optional.
