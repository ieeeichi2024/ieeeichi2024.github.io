                <h2>Workshops</h2>
                <p>
                    Workshops are an integral part of ICHI 2022 and will be held on the day prior to the start of the main program (August 8th, 2022). Workshops at ICHI 2022 may be planned for a full or half day, and should address topics relevant to healthcare informatics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideal ICHI 2022 workshop proposal will focus on a timely and emerging topic, and be able to attract a number of interesting and high-quality contributions that spark discussions in an informal setting. The organizers can determine the format of the workshop that may include paper presentations, poster sessions, invited talks, panels, or any other type of activity that will foster interaction and discussion. The approved workshop organizers will be responsible to invite and review submissions, plan the workshop program, and organize the workshop.
