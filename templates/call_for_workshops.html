                <h2>Workshops</h2>
                <p>
                    Following the success of workshops at the past IEEE International Conference of Healthcare Informatics (ICHI), we cordially invite you to submit your workshop proposal to ICHI 2024 to be organized in Orlando, Florida, United States of America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Workshops are an integral part of ICHI 2024 and will be held on the day prior to the start of the main program (June 3rd, 2024). Workshops at ICHI 2024 may be planned for a full or half day, and should address topics relevant to healthcare informatics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideal ICHI 2024 workshop proposal will focus on a timely and emerging topic and attract many interesting and high-quality contributions that spark discussions in an informal setting. The organizers can determine the workshop format, which may include paper presentations, poster sessions, invited talks, panels, or any other activity that will foster interaction and discussion. The approved workshop organizers will be responsible for inviting and reviewing submissions, planning the workshop program, and organizing the workshop.

                        Reviewing will be done by the Workshop Chairs and independent reviewers as needed. Workshops will be accepted based on the timeliness of the topic, relevance to ICHI, potential to attract a sufficient number of participants, and potential of the workshop to spark discussions and achieve impact in the research community.
