                <p>
                    Workshops are an integral part of ICHI 2023 and will be held on the day prior to the start of the main program (June 26th, 2023). Workshops at ICHI 2023 may be planned for a full or half day, and should address topics relevant to healthcare informatics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ideal ICHI 2023 workshop proposal will focus on a timely and emerging topic and attract many interesting and high-quality contributions that spark discussions in an informal setting. The organizers can determine the workshop format, which may include paper presentations, poster sessions, invited talks, panels, or any other activity that will foster interaction and discussion. The approved workshop organizers will be responsible for inviting and reviewing submissions, planning the workshop program, and organizing the workshop.
