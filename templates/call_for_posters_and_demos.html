            <h2>Posters and Demos</h2>
            <p>
                Posters and demos are an excellent way to present innovative ideas, late-breaking work, concepts, work-in-progress, early stages of research, and preliminary results from implementation and validations to academic and industrial audience.
                The submissions should fit the theme and main topics of the conference – analytics, human factors, and system. However, it is not necessary to select a specific track for the submission.

                <p>
                    Poster and demo submissions should be 1-2 pages (excluding references) in the same format as full and short papers (see Call for Papers for detailed instructions). Demo submissions may have an additional appendix page, describing and possibly showing images of the demo to be presented at ICHI.

                    This additional page is only for use in review; it does not need to conform to any formatting requirements and must be excluded from the camera-ready submission.
