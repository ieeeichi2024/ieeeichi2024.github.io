                    The IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics Series has been fostering the active

                    solutions in the field. One or more of the following criteria will be used to determine
                    appropriateness for acceptance: demonstration of path for integration into product, demonstration of
                    current clinical usage and impact on workflow, demonstration of significant improvement to current
                    care practice through clinical validation.

                <p>
                    The industry track will accept both short papers and demonstrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short papers (max. 4 pages) should describe innovative ideas or implementations of practical
                    significance with validated results. They may also provide insight into issues and factors that
                    affect the successful use and deployment of information and analytics systems or new interesting
                    discoveries made from data that are useful to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Demo papers (max. 4 pages) should include all parts of other demo proposals: title, abstract, body,
                    and bibliography. Demo papers should provide a description of the objective of the system, the novel
                    intellectual content of the underlying system and of the system architecture. In addition, an
                    overview of what would be demonstrated to the audience should be clearly explained. The system
                    should solve a non-trivial, real-world problem. We encourage authors to add links to slides or
                    videos giving a visual feel for what the demo and demo flow will look like.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Papers for the industry track should be in the same format as full and short papers (see <a href="./call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a> for detailed instructions).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Details on how and where to submit industry track papers will be published soon.
