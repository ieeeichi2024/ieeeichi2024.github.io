                <p>
                    The industry track will accept both short papers and demonstrations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short papers (4-6 pages) should describe innovative ideas or implementations of practical significance with validated results. They may also provide insight into issues and factors that affect the successful use and deployment of information and analytics systems or present new interesting discoveries made from data that are useful to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Demo papers (max. 4 pages) should include all of the necessary elements that other demo proposals have, including title, abstract, body, and bibliography. Demo papers should provide a description of the system’s objective, the innovative ideas behind it, and the system's architecture. In addition, they should also provide a clear overview of what will be demonstrated to the audience. The system should address a non-trivial, real-world problem. We encourage authors to add links to slides or videos that showcase the demo and provide a visual representation of the demo flow.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Papers for the industry track must adhere to the same format as full and short papers (see <a href="./call_for_papers.html">Call for Papers</a> for detailed instructions).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Submissions must adhere to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings Format</a>. Submissions should be made in the ICHI EasyChair system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ieeeichi2024 (Choose “Industry Track")
