                        <b>Abstract:</b> The great promise of innovative technologies such as AI is that they will advance human health by helping us summarize information, make diagnoses, predict health outcomes, or offer recommendations. However, as we develop ways for doctors or patients to use AI outputs for decisions, it is critical to recognize that information alone does not determine peoples’ decisions. We are also heavily influenced by our environment – whether physical or electronic – and the options that it presents us. These options and the ways they are presented are collectively known as the “choice architecture.” Aspects of the choice architecture which encourage people to select certain options are generally known as “nudges.” Using case studies from biomedical informatics, I will show how choice architectures shape our day-to-day decisions in ways that we are not always aware of, and how they may interfere with the ability to apply information to make decisions. I will also demonstrate how people who design information technologies are in a unique position to leverage intentional choice architectures to reduce cognitive burden and nudge people to select the best option. By broadening our understanding of human decision-making processes, we maximize the likelihood that AI will deliver on its promise.

                        <b>Abstract:</b> The explosion of biomedical big data and information in the past decade or so has created new opportunities for discoveries to improve the treatment and prevention of human diseases. As such, the field of medicine is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by AI-powered analytical solutions. This talk explores the benefits (and risks) of AI and ChatGPT, highlighting their pivotal roles in revolutionizing biomedical discovery, patient care, diagnosis, treatment, and medical research. By demonstrating their uses in some real-world applications such as improving PubMed searches (Fiorini et al., <i>Nature Biotechnology</i> 2018), supporting precision medicine (LitVar, Allot et al., <i>Nature Genetics</i> 2023), and accelerating patient trial matching (TrialGPT), we underscore the potential of AI and ChatGPT in enhancing clinical decision-making, personalizing patient experiences, and accelerating knowledge discovery.

                    </p>

                    <p>Dr. Gurses is a globally recognized researcher, educator, and thought leader in infusing human factors engineering principles and methods into health care with the goal to design better and safer work environments and systems for improving patient safety and health care worker safety. She is the Founding Director of the Center for Health Care Human Factors at the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute and Professor in the Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine, Bloomberg Public Health and Whiting Engineering. She is the author of more than 100 peer-reviewed publications on human factors engineering, human-centered design, usability evaluation, patient safety and quality of care, and health care worker safety. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Gurses’s current research efforts include, but not limited to human-centered and health-IT based clinical work system design, modeling cognitive and team work to improve diagnostic safety in emergency department, re-engineering complex work systems to reduce healthcare-associated infections, improving safe management air flow and aerosol generating procedures in the operating rooms to reduce infection transmission, improving safety of care transitions/ handoffs, and using human factors-based approaches to improve patient-care professional partnership for improving medication safety. Dr. Gurses has conducted research in a variety of care settings, including hospitals, ambulatory care, long-term care, and home care, as well as transitions of care between these settings. Her research program has been funded by the CDC, AHRQ, NIH, NSF, multiple foundations and private institutions. Dr. Gurses served as a member of an ad-hoc National Academies Committee on a 2-year effort that produced the 2022 report titled “Frameworks for Protecting Workers and the Public from Inhalation Hazards.” She also served as an Editor/ Scientific Editor for several journals in her field of expertise and currently is an Executive Committee Member of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.  Dr. Gurses received multiple awards for her contributions to the science of safety, including the Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences Foundation Award, Liberty Mutual Award on Safety, and the International Ergonomics Association Best Paper Award in Occupational Safety and Ergonomics.</p>

                    <p>In addition to advancing the science of safety, Dr. Gurses’s health care human factors program has had a wide practical impact in the frontline clinical work. For example, when the Ebola epidemic hit in 2014, she led the Armstrong Institute’s efforts in partnering with the CDC to develop a web-based training to prepare health care professionals for potential Ebola cases by integrating human factors and industrial engineering, implementation science, and public health principles and methods with infection control and prevention and clinical expertise. Currently, as part of the CDC’s Project Firstline Initiative, and in collaboration with the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory, Dr. Gurses is leading a large-scale, multidisciplinary, innovative project aimed at improving infection prevention and control in the operating rooms using engineering-based approaches across the nation. </p>
