                        <b>Abstract:</b> Neural networks have achieved great success in many tasks. However, their black-box nature limits their use in sensitive areas such as medical applications in which both performance in accuracy and intelligibility are critically important. In this talk, I will discuss our recent research on explainable deep tabular learning, a specific kind of deep learning models for tabular data which is very common in medical and healthcare applications. In particular, I will show how the concept-based learning models and example-based learning models can be designed for explainable deep tabular learning. I will also discuss their applications in biomedicine and healthcare.

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Patient safety informatics is an important area of research because despite our good intentions, medical harms are a principal cause of preventable injury and remain a leading cause of death in the Unites States and globally. Data science and informatics offer significant opportunities for improving patient safety, including the ability to develop predictive models that can identify patients at risk of adverse events and interventions including clinical decision support that can mitigate those risks. Additionally, advanced analytics can help healthcare providers identify patterns and trends that may indicate safety concerns, allowing for proactive interventions to prevent harm. This presentation will highlight data science and informatics tools and approaches that have the potential to significantly improve patient safety and reduce the risk of adverse events in healthcare settings.

                    </p>

                    <p>Dr. Gurses is a globally recognized researcher, educator, and thought leader in infusing human factors engineering principles and methods into health care with the goal to design better and safer work environments and systems for improving patient safety and health care worker safety. She is the Founding Director of the Center for Health Care Human Factors at the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute and Professor in the Johns Hopkins University Schools of Medicine, Bloomberg Public Health and Whiting Engineering. She is the author of more than 100 peer-reviewed publications on human factors engineering, human-centered design, usability evaluation, patient safety and quality of care, and health care worker safety. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Gurses’s current research efforts include, but not limited to human-centered and health-IT based clinical work system design, modeling cognitive and team work to improve diagnostic safety in emergency department, re-engineering complex work systems to reduce healthcare-associated infections, improving safe management air flow and aerosol generating procedures in the operating rooms to reduce infection transmission, improving safety of care transitions/ handoffs, and using human factors-based approaches to improve patient-care professional partnership for improving medication safety. Dr. Gurses has conducted research in a variety of care settings, including hospitals, ambulatory care, long-term care, and home care, as well as transitions of care between these settings. Her research program has been funded by the CDC, AHRQ, NIH, NSF, multiple foundations and private institutions. Dr. Gurses served as a member of an ad-hoc National Academies Committee on a 2-year effort that produced the 2022 report titled “Frameworks for Protecting Workers and the Public from Inhalation Hazards.” She also served as an Editor/ Scientific Editor for several journals in her field of expertise and currently is an Executive Committee Member of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.  Dr. Gurses received multiple awards for her contributions to the science of safety, including the Federation of Associations in Behavioral and Brain Sciences Foundation Award, Liberty Mutual Award on Safety, and the International Ergonomics Association Best Paper Award in Occupational Safety and Ergonomics.</p>

                    <p>In addition to advancing the science of safety, Dr. Gurses’s health care human factors program has had a wide practical impact in the frontline clinical work. For example, when the Ebola epidemic hit in 2014, she led the Armstrong Institute’s efforts in partnering with the CDC to develop a web-based training to prepare health care professionals for potential Ebola cases by integrating human factors and industrial engineering, implementation science, and public health principles and methods with infection control and prevention and clinical expertise. Currently, as part of the CDC’s Project Firstline Initiative, and in collaboration with the JHU Applied Physics Laboratory, Dr. Gurses is leading a large-scale, multidisciplinary, innovative project aimed at improving infection prevention and control in the operating rooms using engineering-based approaches across the nation. </p>

                        <b>Abstract:</b> Drawing on 25 years of personal and professional research experience in the fields of acoustics, psychology, diabetes, and data science, this presentation will share some of the general patterns (and problems) that exist across multiple and disparate disciplines. Perhaps these general patterns, or universal principles, hold the keys to solving complex system problems? This talk will cover some general topics such as the importance of starting with why, fusing human expertise and AI technology, and creating trusted interdependent systems. Real-world examples from the field of diabetes will be given with a focus on patient-centered care using just-in-time-adaptive interventions and clinician facing precision engagements.
